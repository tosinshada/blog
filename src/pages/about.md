I currently live in lagos and trying to build solutions with dotnet, typescript, rust, python and java. 
I'm interested in functional programming languages like haskell and elixir and would love to build a side 
project with them soon. I am also a fan of the applications of AI (not machine learning for now). I am 
currently learning Lawn Tennis and planning to start piano lessons soon.

I will be using this space to share my thoughts on software development, AI, tennis, music and life in 
general. I hope you find something useful here.

## Tech Stack

I currently use .net core at my day job. I am also familiar with rust, nodejs, python and java. I have 
a keen interest in functional programming languages like Haskell and Elixir.

If you'd like to discuss you can reach me at my [email](mailto:tosinshada@gmail.com).
